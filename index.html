        You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to Custom
        Elements, which are part of the Web Components Spec. That’s because
        Vue’s component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec. For example,
        Vue components implement the Slot API and the is special attribute.
        However, there are a few key differences: 
        <ol><li>The Web Components Spec has
        been finalized, but is not natively implemented in every browser. Safari
        10.1+, Chrome 54+ and Firefox 63+ natively support web components. In
        comparison, Vue components don’t require any polyfills and work
        consistently in all supported browsers (IE9 and above). When needed, Vue
        components can also be wrapped inside a native custom element.</li>
        <li>Vue
        components provide important features that are not available in plain
        custom elements, most notably cross-component data flow, custom event
        communication and build tool integrations. Although Vue doesn’t use
        custom elements internally, it has great interoperability when it comes
        to consuming or distributing as custom elements. Vue CLI also supports
        building Vue components that register themselves as native custom
        elements.</li>

           in Vue, because it’s an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications

            often reusable components. 
            If we think about it, almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components`,
